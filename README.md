# Python-Games
In this repository  I am going to store the games that we can make using the some of the specific libraries of python language  
Python is the most versatile language, and it makes its presence almost in every field including Web-development, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, GUI Application as well as Game Development.

Python provides a built-in library called pygame, which used to develop the game. Once we understand the basic concepts of Python programming, we can use the pygame library to make games with attractive graphics, suitable animation, and sound.

Pygame is a cross-platform library that is used to design video games. It includes computer graphics and sound libraries to give the standard game experience to the user.

It is developed by Pete Shinners to replace PySDL.
